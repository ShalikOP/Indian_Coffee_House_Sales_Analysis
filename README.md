# Indian Coffee House Sales Analysis

The main objective of this project is to analyze retail sales data to gain actionable insights that will enhance the performance of the Coffee Shop.

## Project Objectives and Recommended Analysis

The primary goal was to analyze retail sales data to gain insights that could help improve the coffee shopâ€™s operations and sales strategies. The specific questions I aimed to answer included:

- How do sales vary by day of the week and hour of the day?
- Are there any peak times for sales activity?
- What is the total revenue for each month?
- How do sales vary across different store locations?
- What is the average price per person?
- Which products are the best-selling in terms of quantity and revenue?
- How do sales vary by product category and type?

## Process/Steps Undertaken

- Data Cleaning and Transformation Raw Data:
I started with the raw data, which included transaction details such as transaction ID, date, time, store location, product details, and pricing.


- Data Transformation : 
Using Power Query, I cleaned and transformed the data by adding new columns such as total bill, month name, day name, hour, day of the week, and month. This process helped in organizing the data for better analysis.

- Data Analysis:
Here we have created many different Pivot Table to Analyze different metrics and to further create Dashboard
